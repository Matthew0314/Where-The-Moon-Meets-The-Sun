Where the Moon Meets the Sun is a tactical role-playing game Iâ€™ve been developing in Unity since the fall of 2023. 
Inspired by video games like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics, the game features grid-based combat where players 
will strategically maneuver their units to defeat opposing enemy units. Each map presents different objectives, such as 
routing all enemies, defeating the boss unit, or safely moving all units to the escape point. Players must balance 
completing these objectives with the challenge of preventing their units from falling, as when a unit dies they are gone 
for good. However, fallen units can be utilized to provide stat boosts and other benefits to surviving units in future maps. 
The game offers a compelling blend of tactical decision-making and strategic planning, while also immersing the player in a 
complex and emotional story.

What Has Been Implemented:
- Developed grid generation that stores movement and position data for each tile
- Designed algorithms that dictacts where a unit can move and attack on the grid based on their stats
- Impleemnted a database that stores character and class statistics which can be easily called and manipulated during gameplay

What Is Being Worked On Right Now:
- Enabling player units to traverse the grid
- Developing a turn system that will only allow a unit to act once per turn
- Integrating capabilities for units to execute attacks, utilize items, wait for the next turn.
- Designing enemy AI, allowing them to choose which actions to take against the player
