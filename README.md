Where the Moon Meets the Sun is a tactical role-playing game Iâ€™ve been developing in Unity since the fall of 2023. 
Inspired by video games like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics, the game features grid-based combat where players 
will strategically maneuver their units to defeat opposing enemy units. Each map presents different objectives, such as 
routing all enemies, defeating the boss unit, or safely moving all units to the escape point. Players must balance 
completing these objectives with the challenge of preventing their units from falling, as when a unit dies they are gone 
for good. However, fallen units can be utilized to provide stat boosts and other benefits to surviving units in future maps. 
The game offers a compelling blend of tactical decision-making and strategic planning, while also immersing the player in a 
complex and emotional story.

- Designed algorithms that dictates where units can move and attack based on their stats.
- Implemented a database that stores character and class statistics.
- Integrated capabilities for units to execute attacks.
- Developed a user interface allowing players to see the expected outcome of each action.
- Designed unique enemy AI, allowing each opposing unit to determine the best action to take against the player.
- Developed a tutorial level designed to teach the player the mechanics of the game.
